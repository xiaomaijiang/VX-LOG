[[xm_fileop]]
==== File Operations (xm_fileop)

This module provides functions and procedures to manipulate files.
Coupled with a <<config_module_schedule,Schedule>> block, this module
allows various log rotation and retention policies to be implemented,
including:

* log file retention based on file size,
* log file retention based on file age, and
* cyclic log file rotation and retention.

NOTE: Rotating, renaming, or removing the file written by
      <<om_file,om_file>> is also supported with the help of the
      _om_file_ <<om_file_proc_reopen,reopen()>> procedure.
