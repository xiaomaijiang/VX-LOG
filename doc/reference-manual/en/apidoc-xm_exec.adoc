===== Procedures

The following procedures are exported by xm_exec.

[[xm_exec_proc_exec]]
`exec(<<lang_type_string,string>> command, <<lang_type_varargs,varargs>> args);`::
+
--

Execute _command_, passing it the supplied arguments, and wait for it
to terminate. The command is executed in the caller module's
context. Note that the module calling this procedure will block until
the process terminates. Use the
<<xm_exec_proc_exec_async,exec_async()>> procedure to
avoid this problem. All output written to standard output and standard
error by the spawned process is discarded.

and does not wait for it to terminate.
